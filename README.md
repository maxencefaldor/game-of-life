# Conway's Game of Life
Memory efficient implementation of Conway's Game of Life in C.

The objective of this project is to implement the cellular automaton [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in C, coding data structure from scratch. Memory efficiency is achieved using linked list to store alive cells instead of the full grid. I gained experience with GNU/Linux and tools like gcc, ddd, valgrid and GNU make.

The program can load grids from text files, run a customizable number of generations and generate a GIF to visualize the automaton in action.
